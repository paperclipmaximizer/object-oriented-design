The default access modifier will only allow access to attributes and methods to subclasses or classes that are part of the same package or encapsulation. This access modifier is also called the **no modifier** access because you do not need to explicitly declare it. 
```java
public class Person {
	String name; 
}
```
*This is default cos we havent set an access modifier.*
